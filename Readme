This is a simple chat server/client as an exercise to 
learn Go. Expect little functionality and lots of bugs.

Install:
simply set $GOPATH appropriately, then clone
the repository and `go install github.com/zandi/chat-go/chat`.
replace `chat` with `client` and `server` to build the 
client and server binaries, respectively.

See http://golang.org/doc/code.html for how to set
up the workspace. It is assumed you've followed
the same directory structure conventions mentioned there.
Specifically, that `$GOPATH/src/github.com/zandi/chat-go`
is where you've cloned the repo into.
